        <h1>Picking Your Parts is important!</h1>
        <p>Before building your PC, you should know what it is used for. Whether you are using it for work or for gaming, determining the use should be the first thing you consider.</p>
        <p>Here's why picking the right PC parts is crucial:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Performance Optimization:</strong> Different tasks require different hardware configurations. Selecting compatible and high-performance components ensures smooth operation.</li>
            <li><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Ensure all components work seamlessly together to prevent issues like bottlenecking or system instability.</li>
            <li><strong>Cost-effectiveness:</strong> Avoid overspending on unnecessary features or underspending on critical ones to get the best value for your budget.</li>
            <li><strong>Future Upgradability:</strong> Leave room for future upgrades by selecting components with ample expansion options.</li>
            <li><strong>Reliability and Longevity:</strong> Invest in quality components from reputable manufacturers to reduce the risk of failures and ensure a stable computing experience.</li>
            <li><strong>Customization:</strong> Tailor your PC to your specific needs and preferences, whether it's for aesthetics, performance, or features.</li>
